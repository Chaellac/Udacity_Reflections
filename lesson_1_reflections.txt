Diff: Comparison points out spelling errors quickly.

Access to entire history: Easy to know when a change was made or error introduced.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Cons:
Not saving when needed or forgetting.
Too much difference between commits.
Pros:
Only necessary commits created.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Specifically designed with coding in mind.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
log lets you see the list of commits done with the annotations.
diff let you view changes in all files inside the repository for each commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can always go back to a stable version when needed.
